# ROADMAP

## Conversational Mode
- Core of the system.  
- Deterministic command interface (text-based).  
- Add LLM layer for natural language and voice interaction.  

## Graphical Mode
- Separate interaction mode.  
- Built after conversational mode is solid.  
- Uses the same backend actions.  

## Core System
- Shared logic, data, and state management.  
- Independent of the chosen interaction mode.
